We are **Elisa Navarro & Noemí Esteras**, two young PIs joining forces to deepen in the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases. Our lab is located in the School of Medicine at [Universidad Complutense de Madrid](https://www.ucm.es/). We are a multidisciplinary team who share research interests and a common view on many aspects of science. We are interested in understanding the molecular basis of neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, we focus on the role of mitochondria and the immnune system in the development of diseases such as Alzheimer´s, Parkinson´s and frontotemporal dementia. We are both passionate about different aspects of neuroscience, from microglia to neurons, from transcriptomics to live imaging, from mitochondria to lipid metabolism. We are committed to create a supportive environment for learning, encouraging collaborative opportunities, independence and growth.
