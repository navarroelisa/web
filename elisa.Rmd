# **Meet Elisa Navarro (she/hers/hers)**
## **About me**
I hold a major in Biochemistry from UCM and completed my Ph.D. at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid under the guidance of Dr. Manuela García López. My doctoral research focused on investigating the role of the alpha7 nicotinic receptor in controlling inflammation as a potential target for neuroprotection.<br/>

After completing my Ph.D., I embarked on a postdoctoral research journey in New York City at Mount Sinai Hospital. Working under the supervision of Dr. Towfique Raj, I contributed to the [Ronald M. Loeb Center for Alzheimer’s Disease](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/loeb-alzheimers). My work specifically involved the development of MyND, a multidisciplinary effort aimed at recruiting innate immune cells from patients suffering from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

In 2020, I returned to my hometown, Madrid. Currently, I serve as an Assistant Professor in the Biochemistry department at UCM, where I balance teaching and research responsibilities. I am part of the [Cannabinoids research group](https://www.ucm.es/grupos/grupo/73). I have recently established my independent research line, supported by the Ministry of Science and Innovation.

## **Ongoing projects**
I am a **microglial lover** interested in understanding the role of the innate immune system in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. I am currently working in different lines of investigation

**DARDAGLIA**

This project focuses in studying LRRK2 (or dardarin) which is a protein-coding gene. Mutations in this gene increase the risk to develop Parkinson´s disease, although the exact molecular mechanisms are still elusive. With this project I am interestied in diving in the function of LRRK2 controlling microglial homeostasis and functionality, especially its role in participating in lipid metabolism. Thus, Dardaglia project was born in an attempt to disentangle the role of dardarin (LRRK2) in microglia through regulation of lipid metabolism. This project is supported by the Ministry of Science and Innovation. 

**CANNABINOIDS IN PARKINSON DISEASE**

I also collaborate with Dr. Javier Fernandez Ruiz studying the role of the Cannabinoid system in Parkinson´s disease. We use different strategies to modulate the cannabonoid system as a target for neuroportection. We are currently working in undertstanding the role of GPR55 receptor as a potential driver of Parkinson´s disease.
