### *We are committed to promote scientific advocacy and make neuroscience more accessible to the public*

As part of our mission we actively participate in a variety of events aiming to promote scientific advocacy at different levels

</br>
</br>

### **Semana de la Ciencia (Week of Science)**

Every year, we participate in the Week of Science. We prepare activities for secondary education students. With these activities, they can learn different techniques that we use in the lab, from tissue staining to imaging. They also learn about brain´s anatomy and fun facts about the endocannabinoid system.

Outreach, academic learning and serving the community meet at *Service-learning* project. Noemí and Elisa actively participate in this initiative organized at UCM. Our project is entitled *"Movies in Company for Preventing Diseases"*. Our goal is to engage students in learning activities, while addressing health-related issues of people at risk of social exclusion in their local environment. With this project, we aim to bring the students scientific and academic knowledge to different communities.
