Check our latest publications! A couple of reviews about the role of [Nrf2](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/13/12/1502) in different cell types of the brain as well as the role of [MAM](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11775980/pdf/10.1177_25152564241312807.pdf) in microglial functionality. We have also participated as invited expert [comment](https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/febs.17155) about how mutations in *FBXO7* gene associated to Parkinson´s disease affect mitochondrial and proteasomal activity.

June 2024 has been exhausting! Santi did amazing (as always!) in #Farmadrid30 & Sara Pardo in CEBBM presenting their work about GPR55 in the context of Parkinson. Moreover, David, Sara and Alicia rocked in the defense of their final degree projects. Plus, Mamen is officially a new PhD student of the #Mitoglia Lab after receiving a competitive CAM fellowship.
